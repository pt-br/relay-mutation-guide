#### This guide will fit if you find yourself into one(or more) of the following situations:
* I'm freaking out about how to handle mutations on GraphQL and Relay;
* I tried reading someone else's code, but it's not too much explained and it's complex;
* The examples I found on internet have less explanation and a lots of code that will output something only 1h after going through the tutorial;
* Star Wars' example of facebook sucks.
