#### This guide will fit if you find yourself into one(or more) of the following situations:
* I'm freaking out about how to handle mutations on GraphQL and Relay;
* I tried reading someone else's code, but it's not too much explained and it's complex;
* The examples I found on internet have less explanation and a lots of code that will output something only 1h after going through the tutorial;
* Star Wars' example of facebook sucks.

### Intro
In this guide we will be creating a simple application that uses a real world example to get things easier for you.
It's important to say that this is not a complete guide for GraphQL and Relay, the focus of this guide is only on **Mutations**.

So, before you get started, be sure to know at least the basics of:

* ES6
* React
* GraphQL
* GraphiQL

### Getting the playground
As I said, we will be working on an application for this guide. You can check it running accessing a <a targe="_blank" href="https://relay-phones.herokuapp.com">demo build on heroku</a>. I've prepared a special boilerplate of this application, removing everything related to mutations, so we can do it together on this guide.

Let's put the hand on the code, start by clonning the boilerplate:
